1. Peter Naur is famously quoted as saying data science “deals with the data, while the actual relation 
   of data to what they represent should occur in other fields.” Why do you think he’d choose to frame data 
   science this way? What might be problematic in this statement?  

      I believed he framed his understanding of data science this way to simply highlight the fact that data in itself
      should be its own individual focus and field rather than being only portrayed as statistics or mathematics. I believe
      he did not fully understand that the field of data science would later grow to encapsulate all sorts of analysis, visualization,
      and methodology. Only problem with his statement is that by neglecting to take into consideration what your data actually pertains
      to, you are failing to completely understand your data; therefore failing to see reasonable connections and create functional answers
      to the problems you are trying to achieve.


2. In 2002, data science began to gain momentum as its own dedicated subfield. Compare and contrast the definitions
    of data science at that time, exemplified by the National Science Foundation, Data Science Journal, and Journal of 
    Data Science, to those from Tukey & Naur in the 1970s.
       
       The definitions offered in 2002, as the field of data science began to emerge, was that of overall incorporation.
        The newer definitions generally included all aspect of data, as it should. Encapsulating fields of statistics, mathematics,
        analytics, programmers and any field that had to do with the curration, management, modeling, sorting, and analysis of data.
        Prior to this, during the 70's, was a very close minded definition of data science. Naur for example exclaimed that data
        science should only deal with data, while relation of data should occur in other fields. This definition is representative 
        of people seeing data science as simply dealing with numbers and data, while analysis and other similar methods should be dealt with
        according to its most relative cooresponding field outside of data science.


      


3.  Data continues to grow at an exponential rate today. List at least three technological factors that contribute to 
   this growth. List three major sources of data that contribute to this growth.

        Three major technological factors that contribute to this growth can be technical ubiquity, Moore's Law or technologically 
         steady advancement, and social exponentiation. Three major sources that can be attributed to growing the amount of readily
         avaiable data are that of social media sites, cellular phone data from location to pictures or even microphone use, and 
         popular searching applications such as google, bing, or yahoo aggregating regular internet use. 
        
      * User data for business analytics and predictive advertisements
      * Popularized technology, increased access to the internet or popular tech
      * Technical ubiquity 
      * Social media
      * Moore’s law
      * Social exponentiation 




Part 2
*  How would you move into each of the following directories from the shell? Why do you think it is 
   important to have shortcuts for each of these directories for navigating the file structure?
   * A. Root
      * cd /
   * B. Home
      * cd ~
   * C. Parent
      * cd ..
* Briefly describe what the following set of commands would achieve. What process would happen and what 
   would be printed to the command line?
   * cd ~
   * mkdir ./problem_set_1
   * cd ..
   * Pwd
      * The process that is happening is that you are making a new directory in your base directory.
         Cd ~ , will revert you to your home directory usually being user/yourname. You are then making
         a new, empty directory called problem_set_1 in your home directory. You then go back out to the
         parent of your current directory, which in this case is your root directory that you can get to 
         using cd /. You then use pwd to check which directly you are in, in this case the root directory 
         which it will print. This will print /users, for most terminals.
